Nonograms, also known as Picross, Griddlers, or Nonogram puzzles, are a popular type of logic puzzle that requires a combination of creative thinking and deductive reasoning to solve. These puzzles use a grid, typically rectangular, and the objective is to determine which cells should be filled in and which should be left blank to reveal a hidden picture or pattern.

Here's a description of how nonograms work:

--Grid: Nonograms start with a blank grid. The grid is divided into rows and columns, with each row and column having a sequence of numbers associated with it. These numbers are the key to solving the puzzle.

--Clues: The sequences of numbers act as clues. They indicate the lengths and order of consecutive filled cells in that particular row or column. For example, a sequence "3 1 2" in a row means there are three consecutive filled cells, followed by one filled cell, and then two more consecutive filled cells, separated by at least one blank cell.

--Deduction: Solving a nonogram involves deducing which cells in the grid should be filled and which should be blank. Players use the clues and logic to make educated guesses and fill in cells based on what they know.
